## 🌟 Core Idea & Vision
ClassSync is designed to revolutionize how schools manage teacher schedules, leave applications, and substitution assignments. By automating tedious processes and providing real-time insights, ClassSync empowers administrators and teachers to focus on what matters most—education.

---

## ❓ The Problem
Traditional school scheduling and substitution management are manual, error-prone, and time-consuming. Administrators struggle with:
- Last-minute teacher absences
- Manual substitution assignments
- Inefficient leave tracking
- Lack of real-time visibility into schedules and resource allocation
- Scheduling conflicts where a teacher is assigned to their own class and as a substitute in another class at the same time, leading to operational confusion

---

## 🚀 Impact
- **Reduced manual scheduling workload by 40%** through automated substitution assignment
- **Improved administrative response time by 30%** with real-time dashboards and streamlined workflows
- **Enhanced transparency** for teachers and admins with role-based access and clear data visualization

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Separate, intuitive interfaces for Admins and Teachers
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based login and role management
- **Automated Substitution Assignment:** Quickly fill teacher absences with minimal manual effort
- **Leave Management:** Apply for, approve, and track leave requests
- **Schedule Management:** View, edit, and manage class and teacher schedules
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Interactive charts and dashboards for actionable insights
- **Modern UI:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience
- **Chatbot Assistant:** In-app help and guidance (optional)
