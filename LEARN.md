## 🏗️ Project Structure & Architecture
ClassSync is a monorepo with clear separation between frontend and backend:

```
ClassSync/
├── backend/    # Node.js, Express, MongoDB REST API
├── frontend/   # React, Vite, Tailwind CSS SPA
└── LEARN.md   # (You are here)
```
- **Frontend:** Modern SPA with role-based routing, dashboards, and real-time charts
- **Backend:** Secure REST API with authentication, scheduling, leave, and substitution logic
